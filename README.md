 Week 1.

I sketched out how my project would look like in my page but I have the feeling that it might change as I go. Sometimes when I add information, or applications if I don't feel it looks good all together, I would change it to something else. This week I work on gathering the information such as pictures, text, and information. I created my navigation bar, my buttons, my background images and five charts. I finished all my five charts. Although if I feel I need more,I might add more charts. I worked on my html, css, and javascript. More importantly, I  found a way to add my images as my background. This part was hard because I needed to make each and everyone of them the background. I did a lot of research on the web and I decided to use css and html to implement this functionality. I also added some javascript to make the buttons (start here, click here and click here to restart) responsive. I started adding some media queries to make my page responsive to different devices.
