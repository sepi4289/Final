 Week 1.

I sketched out how my project would look like in my page but I have the feeling that it might change as I go. Sometimes when I add information, or applications if I don't feel it looks good all together, I would change it to something else. This week I work on gathering the information such as pictures, text, and information. I created my navigation bar, my buttons, my background images and five charts. I finished all my five charts. Although if I feel I need more,I might add more charts. I worked on my html, css, and javascript. More importantly, I  found a way to add my images as my background. This part was hard because I needed to make each and everyone of them the background. I did a lot of research on the web and I decided to use css and html to implement this functionality. I also added some javascript to make the buttons (start here, click here and click here to restart) responsive. I started adding some media queries to make my page responsive to different devices.

Week 2

Fo this week I focus on making the page responsive. I had to make so adjustment and delete some ccs and work with bootstrap with would also help me to use less media queries. First,I made sure all of the navBar buttons( Home, About, and Help) work properly. Second, I add more pages to the site and place the correct information in each an one of them with the proper image as well.Also, I gave each button an attractive name keep the user interested.  Third, I added the chart and and made them work with page. Fourth, I added a footer and inside I place the attribution of each photo  using html and bootstrap to center it. Five, I added a map to the help section and links to take the user to their pages and also to let the user know where are they located.
